# explanations

**the problem statement** is loosely defined as finding a points nearest neighbor from another set in a decently quick amount of time. this specific implementaion focuses on mapping points from a large set to a set with few points.

the [writeup doc](./writeup.pdf) is my brainstorming. if you're curious about what's going on, that might help.

## apologies

**important to note**: I did not proofread the writeup doc at all. that's mearly my way of thinking out loud. very sorry for any mixed wording or symbols.

sorry for the goofy lingo too. I've always thought the way textbook folk write is funny, so this is my goof at that.

also, sorry about the handwriting.
