# binning-problem

a quick little problem of finding the closest pairings between all elements of two sets. decided to go way overboard on the math lingo on my brainstorming cause it's "fun"

problem was gifted to me by Kai. thanks Kai 🙏

## getting started

run `python3 sets/generate_sets.py` for testing data, then start hacking away
